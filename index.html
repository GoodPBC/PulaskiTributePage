            <p>On the hot and bright morning of September 11th 1777, the battlebegan along the the banks of the Brandywine River. at the command of the American forces was none other the Commander in Chief himself; George Washington. Washington made a strategic
              move that in hind sight was a detriment to the cause. Washington mis-calculated the british movement based on bad intelligence. The Brits suddenly appeared to the right flank of the American forces and suddenlyWashington and his men were
              unable to defend their position.A day long unsuccessful battle forced the Washington's Army to retreat.</p>

          <p><b>Casimir Pulaski</b> and his troops played the instrumental role of engaging Howe's British Army and distracting them in order to get them off the heels General Washington. It is not widely publicised, however, if General Pulaski had not shown
            up and forged forward as he did, Washington would have surely been captured and likely put to death. If not for Pulaski, it is likely that we would not be able to live the lives we do and celebrate the fredoms we have today.</p>
